      <p class="salutation">Dear Sir:-
         
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <p class="body_paragraph">Several years ago I sent you, through Mr. G. W. Cable, a story entitled "Rena Walden". You were kind enough to read through it, and expressed a willingness to see more
         of the author's work. You also suggested that the story be re-written along certain
         lines indicated by you.  The attempt was made, but was not successful; in fact the
         story was not sensibly altered.
      </p>
      
      
      <p class="body_paragraph">After five years' study of life and literature, I have recast the story of "Rena Walden",
         having always in mind your criticism and suggestions. It is now a novellete of about
         25,000 words. I would not venture to send it to you again without asking in advance
         whether you would be willing to reconsider it.
      </p>
      
      
      <p class="body_paragraph">I have written considerably more since this story was written but with one exception
         have offered nothing for publication, having been mainly absorbed in other pursuits.
         I always believed in this story as a story, and hope that it may now find favor in some one's eyes as a work of art as well.
      </p>
      
      
      <p class="body_paragraph">If you would be willing to read this story again with a view to its publication in
         the Century, if found available, I shall be glad to forward it when I hear from you
         to that effect. It seemed to interest you before, and I am sure it is in every way
         an improvement on the former version.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <p class="salutation">Very respectfully yours,</p>
