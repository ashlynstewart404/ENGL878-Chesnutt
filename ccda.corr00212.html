      <h4>Horace Traubel (19 December 1858-9 September 1919)</h4>
      <p>Horace Traubel was an American poet, essayist, and author. Traubel was also a
         dedicated Socialist, and one of the founders of the socialist weekly newspaper
         <span class="i">The Worker</span>. He is best known for being Whitman's literary
         executor and author of a nine-volume biography of hitman's final four years
         (1888-1892), entitled <span class="i">Walt Whitman in Camden</span>.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <a id="Colsdream"></a><h4>
         The Colonel's Dream
         
      </h4>
      <p><span class="i">The Colonel's Dream</span> (1905) was Chesnutt's final novel.
         The book gained little critical attention and didn't sell well&#x2014;a reality
         that stood in opposition to the book's dedication: "to bring the forces of
         enlightenment to bear upon the vexed problems which harass the South." <span class="i">The Colonel's Dream</span> tells the story of Colonel French, a
         successful New York businessman and recent widow who returns to his Southern
         birthplace, Clarendon, with his son, Phil. French attempts to advance
         Clarendon's social and economic progress for the modern era, hoping to overcome
         its prejudices, rigid social divisions, and corruptions and finds a nemesis in
         the wealthy convict labor contractor, William Fetters. Ultimately, French
         underestimates the entrenched racism of the town, and despite his best efforts,
         Clarendon appears wholly unchanged.
