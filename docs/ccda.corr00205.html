      <p>Permit me to thank you very cordially for the warmly appreciative mention of myself
         and my writings, especially "The Wife of His Youth,"<a href="#WoHY">
            *
            </a> in the February number of your excellent magazine <span class="add">"</span>The Conservator,<span class="add">"</span> of which you were good enough to send me several copies. My thanks are also due for
         the equally friendly notice of "The Marrow of Tradition"<a href="#MoT">
            *
            </a>, in a former number of The Conservator, signed I think by the initials <span class="add">"</span>A.M.,<span class="add">"</span> which I take to be those of your Associate Editor Miss (?) Montgomerie <a href="#MissMont">
            *
            </a>. The writer who tries to treat these difficult themes in any other than a sensational
         way may not hope to number his readers by the hundreds of thousands, but he can find
         a large reward in the appreciation of discerning souls. This has not been denied me<span class="add">,</span> and of it what you have said constitutes a very valuable part.

      <h4>Horace Traubel (1858-1919)</h4>
      <p>Horace Traubel was an American poet, essayist, and author. Traubel was also a dedicated
         Socialist, and one of the founders of the socialist weekly newspaper <span class="i">The Worker</span>. He is best known for being Whitman's literary executor and author of a nine-volume
         biography of hitman's final four years (1888-1892), entitled <span class="i">Walt Whitman in Camden</span>.
      </p>
      <p>This is one of the earliest letters that Chesnutt send Traubel. The two men had a
         friendly working relationship; Chesnutt was a fan of the magazine that Traubel founded,
         <span class="i">The Conservator</span>, and Traubel consistently praised Chesnutt and his writing in reviews featured in
         his periodical.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <a id="MissMont"></a><br></br><h5>Notes:</h5>
      <h4>Anne Montgomerie Traubel (1872-1906)</h4>
      <p>Anne Montgomerie Traubel was the wife of Horace Traubel. Anne was very involved with
         her husband's work, as she aided him in collecting and organizing Whitman's papers
         and was associate editor of <span class="i">The Conservator</span> (Jerome Loving and Alice L. Birney, ""A Young Woman Meets Walt Whitman": Anne Montgomerie
         Traubel's First Impression of the Poet," <span class="i">Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</span> 12, Fall 1994: 104-5).
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <a id="Conserv"></a><h4>
         The Conservator
         
      </h4>
      <p><span class="i">The Conservator</span> was a monthly newspaper founded and edited by Traubel for 30 years. The newspaper
         frequently reflected its editor's idiosyncratic philosophy and crusaded for libertarian
         principles.
      </p>
      
      <a id="WoHY"></a><h4>
         The Wife of His Youth
         
      </h4>
      <p>After its publication in the <span class="i">Atlantic Monthly</span>, the short story "The Wife of His Youth" became the title piece of his collection
         of nondialect works published in 1899, <span class="i">The Wife of His Youth and Other Stories of the Color Line</span>. As the title suggests, each of the stories in the collection examine racial issues
         of the time.
      </p>
      <p>The review mentioned, signed "T.", calls Chesnutt "a poet" and praises the novel <span class="i">Wife of His Youth</span>. The reviewer writes, "Chesnutt likes to take his stand on this difficult ground
         and depict the struggle of the two natures. For a man or woman of mixed blood practically
         suffers two ostracisms instead of one....Chesnutt does not hesitate to put it under
         his glass and does not shudder over the results of his analysis. His stories, which
         are without formal start or finish are better than sermons. they do more for the negro
         than schools and benefactions....[Chesnutt] knows that his business is to get his
         pictures honest. He is not afraid to trust an honest picture. An honest picture never
         fails" (T. "The Wife of His Youth," <span class="i">The Conservator</span> 12, February 1902: 188).
      </p>
      
      <a id="MoT"></a><h4>
         Marrow of Tradition
         
      </h4>
      <p>Chesnutt's ambitious and complex novel, <span class="i">The Marrow of Tradition</span>, was based on the 1898 race riot in Wilmington, North Carolina, which some of Chesnutt's
         relatives survived. This event left a considerable number of African Americans dead
         and expelled thousands more from their homes. Set in the fictional town of Wellington,
         The Marrow of Tradition centers on two prominent families, the Carterets and the Millers,
         and explores their remarkably intersected lives.
      </p>
      <p>Chesnutt's novel, <span class="i">Marrow of Tradition</span> received a short listing in <span class="i">The Conservator</span> for December 1901 under "Books and Pamphlets Received" (A.M. "Books and Pamphlets
         Received," <span class="i">The Conservator</span> 12, December 1901: 157).
