      <h4>Robert Underwood Johnson (1853-1937)</h4>
      <p>Robert Underwood Johnson, born in 1853, was an editor of The Century
         Magazine from 1879 until 1913. He also served as the American Ambassador to
         Italy from 1920-1921, and was a founding member of the American Copyright
         League. He was a published poet, and active in a number of humanitarian and
         artistic pursuits (Kit Messick, "Biographical Note," <span class="i">Robert
            Underwood Johnson Papers 1875-1937 Finding Aid</span>, The New York Public
         Library, Humanities and Social Sciences Library, Manuscripts and Archives
         Division, 2008: v).

         The Rainbow Chasers
         
      </h4>
      <p>The book "The Rainbow Chasers" is Chesnutt's attempt at entering the popular
         market with a nonracial romance. The conventional story centers on a
         well-meaning, middle-aged bachelor who acts as a go-between for suitors to a
         beautiful widow, who marries the bachelor in the end. Ultimately, Chesnutt is
         unable to find a publisher for this book. (William L. Andrews, <span class="i">The Literary Career of Charles W. Chesnutt</span>, Louisiana State University
         Press, 1999: 121-2).
      </p>
      <p>Chesnutt met with Johnson in New York City on March 24th. On that day,
         he received a letter from Houghton, Mifflin, rejecting his story, "The Rainbow
         Chasers." In response, Chesnutt began searching for a new publisher. Johnson
         declined this manuscript on May 2nd, for not having "the qualities necessary for
         availability as a serial for <span class="i">The Century</span>, though it has
         striking good features for a book" (Charles W. Chesnutt, <span class="i">&#x201c;To
            Be an Author&#x201d;: Letters of Charles W. Chesnutt, 1889-1905</span>, ed. Joseph R.
         McElrath, Jr. and Robert C. Leitz, III, Princeton University Press, 1997:
         145-6).
