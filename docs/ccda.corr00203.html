      <p>Your letter announcing that you could use my story "The March of Progress: gave me

            </a> I thank you sincerely for your frank criticism of the art of the story, and to show
         that I have tried to profit by it, I have re-written the first two paragraphs, and
         have made a new one which I would like to have substituted, if you think it better,
         for the rather bald paragraph which you very correctly liken to an obituary notice&#x2014;it
         needs only the suggestion to likeness. I should be glad to see a proof of the story
