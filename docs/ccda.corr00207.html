         dedicated Socialist, and one of the founders of the socialist weekly newspaper
         <span class="i">The Worker</span>. He is best known for being Whitman's literary
         executor and author of a nine-volume biography of Whitman's final four years
         (1888-1892), entitled <span class="i">Walt Whitman in Camden</span>.

         The Conjure Woman
         
      </h4>
      <p><span class="i">The Conjure Woman</span> is a collection of short
         stories by Chesnutt published in 1899. All of the tales are framed with
         narration by a white Northerner, John, who has travelled to the South with his
         wife, Annie, looking for a place to live. He recounts Uncle Julius, a man who
         was formerly enslaved on the land that the couple is looking to purchase,
         telling John and Annie conjure tales.

         and edited by Traubel for 30 years. The newspaper frequently reflected its

         principles.
