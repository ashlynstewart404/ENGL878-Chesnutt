            </a>, who was visiting recently in Philadelphia, tells me that she came very near
         meeting you, but was called home by a telegram the day before she would have had
         that pleasure. She has given me a couple of photographs which I think Mr.
         Bolivar<a href="#wcb">
            *
            </a> handed to her, and
         for which I thank you very much. It is a pleasure to look upon even the
         counterfeit presentment of the face one of whom I have learned to esteem from
         his writings, and who at the same time has shown his appreciation of my own. I
         hope to meet you personally before very long.
