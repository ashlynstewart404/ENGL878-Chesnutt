      <br></br><p>Dear Sir:-<a href="#rwg">
            *
            </a>
         
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>Several years ago I sent you, through Mr. G. W. Cable<a href="#gwc">
            *
            </a>, a story entitled "Rena Walden"<a href="#rw">
            *
            </a>. You were kind enough to read through it, and expressed a willingness to see more
         of the author's work. You also suggested that the story be re-written along certain
         lines indicated by you.  The attempt was made, but was not successful; in fact the
         story was not sensibly altered.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>After five years' study of life and literature, I have recast the story of "Rena Walden",
         having always in mind your criticism and suggestions. It is now a novellete of about
         25,000 words. I would not venture to send it to you again without asking in advance
         whether you would be willing to reconsider it.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I have written considerably more since this story was written but with one exception
         have offered nothing for publication, having been mainly absorbed in other pursuits.
         I always believed in this story as a story, and hope that it may now find favor in some one's eyes as a work of art as well.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>If you would be willing to read this story again with a view to its publication in
         the Century, if found available, I shall be glad to forward it when I hear from you
         to that effect. It seemed to interest you before, and I am sure it is in every way
         an improvement on the former version.
      </p>
      
      
      <br></br><p>Very respectfully yours,</p>
      
      <p>Chas. W. Chesnutt.</p>

      <h2>Notes:</h2>
      
      
      <a id="rwg"></a><h4>Richard Watson Gilder (1844-1909)</h4>
      <p>Richard Watson Gilder was a poet and editor of the Century magazine. &#x41d;e worked as
         a reporter for the Newark Daily Advertiser and the Newark Morning Register before becoming editor of the magazine Hours At Home in 1869. When the latter was merged with the newly-founded Scribner's Monthly the following year, Gilder was made assistant editor under Josiah Gilbert Holland.
         &#x41d;&#x435; succeeded Holland as editor-in-chief in 1881 and turned the publication, renamed
         The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine, into the most renowned and influential general interest magazine in the United States
         ("Overview," Richard Watson Gilder papers, 1855-1916 Manuscripts and Archives Division, The New York Public Library, 1987: 1).
      </p>
      <p>Gilder agreed to reconsider "Rena" on April 17, but he warned Chesnutt that there
         would not be enough space in The Century for a few years and that would be lost time for the story (Charles W. Chesnutt, &#x201c;To Be an Author&#x201d;: Letters of Charles W. Chesnutt, 1889-1905, ed. Joseph R. McElrath, Jr. and Robert C. Leitz, III, Princeton University Press,
         1997: 84).
      </p>
      
      <a id="gwc"></a><h4>George Washington Cable (1844-1925)</h4>
      <p>George Washington Cable, an American author and critic, was born in New Orleans and
         fought for the South in the Civil War. His first collection of tales of life in the
         south was Old Creole Days (1879). Cable and Chesnutt met for the first time in Cleveland, on December 21, 1888,
         at the Congregational Club's Forefather's Day celebration, where Cable was the principal
         speaker. Cable remained Chesnutt's mentor and friend for the duration of his life
         (Charles W. Chesnutt, &#x201c;To Be an Author&#x201d;: Letters of Charles W. Chesnutt, 1889-1905, ed. Joseph R. McElrath, Jr. and Robert C. Leitz, III, Princeton University Press,
         1997: 29-30).
      </p>
      <p>Cable acted as intermediary with Richard Watson Gilder in the spring of 1890. Cable
         sent the original draft of "Rena Walden" in early May 1890, and Gilder rejected this
         first draft on May 28, 1890, claiming, "This story of Chesnutts 'Rena Walden' I have
         read with great care I'm extremely sorry not to find it feasible....There is either
         a lack of humor in the author or a brutality in the characters, &amp; lack of mellowness,
         lack of spontaneous imaginative life in the people, lack of outlook&#x2014;I don't know what&#x2014;that
         makes them&#x2014;as here depicted&#x2014;uninteresting. I think it is the writers fault, rather than the people's. The result seems to me
         a crude study, not a thoroughly human one....(Charles W. Chesnutt, &#x201c;To Be an Author&#x201d;: Letters of Charles W. Chesnutt, 1889-1905, ed. Joseph R. McElrath, Jr. and Robert C. Leitz, III, Princeton University Press,
         1997: 61-7).

         Rena Walden
         
      </h4>
      <p>The manuscript "Rena Walden," which Chesnutt began writing in 1889, is a "tragic mulatto"
         story that was revised several times before being published in expanded form in 1900
         as House Behind the Cedars (Charles W. Chesnutt, &#x201c;To Be an Author&#x201d;: Letters of Charles W. Chesnutt, 1889-1905, ed. Joseph R. McElrath, Jr. and Robert C. Leitz, III, Princeton University Press,
         1997: 37n2).
