      <h4>Horace Traubel (19 December 1858-9 September 1919)</h4>
      <p>Horace Traubel was an American poet, essayist, and author. Traubel was also a dedicated
         Socialist, and one of the founders of the socialist weekly newspaper <span class="i">The Worker</span>. He is best known for being Whitman's literary executor and author of a nine-volume
         biography of hitman's final four years (1888-1892), entitled <span class="i">Walt Whitman in Camden</span>.
      </p>
      
      
      <a id="Conserv"></a><h4>
         The Conservator
         
      </h4>
      <p><span class="i">The Conservator</span> was a monthly newspaper founded and edited by Traubel for 30 years. The newspaper
         frequently reflected its editor's idiosyncratic philosophy and crusaded for libertarian
         principles.
