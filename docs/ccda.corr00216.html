      <br></br><p>Dear Sir:
         
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <p><span class="u">Attention Mr. S. W. Rutherford, Sec'y-Treas.<a href="swr">

               </a></span></p>
      
      <p>I have your letter of February 26th, calling attention to the fact that your records
         show that my subscription expired with the 1922 number, and enclosing bill for $4.00
         covering subscription from January, 1922, to January, 1924.
      </p>
      
      <p>My reference to my own records I find that on January 9, 1922, I sent you a check
         for $2.00 for subscription to the Journal one year in advance, and in return received
         your receipt dated January 10, 1922, reading as follows: "Received of Mr. Charles
         W. Chesnutt, $2.00 for renewal of subscription."  This would seem to indicate that
         your record in this respect is not correct, and that I owe you only $2.00, subscription
         for 1923 in advance, for which I enclose a check.  The Journal is serving a very useful
         purpose and I am very glad to get it, and read it with interest
      </p>

      <h4>S. W. Rutherford (15 September 1866-18 January 1952)</h4>
      <p>Samuel Wilson Rutherford was the Secretary-Treasurer of the Association for the Study
         of African American Life, which published the Journal of Negro History.  He was also
         a close friend of editor Woodson. Rutherford&#x2019;s duties for the journal included managing
         subscription fees and accounts. With his experience and notoriety as a banker in Washington
         D.C., he was well known as a man of business (&#x201c;Samuel Wilson Rutherford." The Journal
         of Negro History 37, no. 2 (1952): 216-17. JSTOR, http://www.jstor.org/stable/2715353).

         The Journal of Negro History
         
      </h4>
      <p><span class="i">The Journal of Negro History</span> was founded in 1916 by Dr. Carter G. Woodson, as one of the first journals to cover
         African American history. Though Chesnutt was consistently a subscriber to the journal,
         he did not contribute any publications.
