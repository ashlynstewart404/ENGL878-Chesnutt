      <p>Your kind note asking me for a word to read on the occasion of the
         Walt Whitman Fellowship Meeting<a href="wwfi">
            *
            </a> on May 31st, came duly to hand. I did not reply promptly because
         I have been exceedingly busy for the past month, and had hoped to be present in
         New York at the date of the meeting, when I should have looked up the convention
         and said my word in person. This I was unfortunately not able to accomplish
         because of business reasons, and I was therefore not in the thing at all<span class="add">,</span> except in spirit. I hope for better luck another time. What I
         look forward to with more pleasure than anything else, had I been able to be in
         New York, was the pleasure of meeting you, which I still hope to enjoy on some
         favorable occasion.

      <h4>Horace Traubel (19 December 1858-9 September 1919)</h4>
      <p>Horace Traubel was an American poet, essayist, and author. Traubel was also a
         dedicated Socialist, and one of the founders of the socialist weekly newspaper
         <span class="i">The Worker</span>. He is best known for being Whitman's literary
         executor and author of a nine-volume biography of Whitman's final four years
         (1888-1892), entitled <span class="i">Walt Whitman in Camden</span>.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <a id="wwfi"></a><h4>Walt Whitman Fellowship: International</h4>
      <p>The Walt Whitman Fellowship: International was formally organized by
         Horace Traubel and several of Whitman's close friends in 1894, two years after
         Whitman's death, in order to ensure that Whitman's literary legacy would
         continue&#x2014;and to celebrate his birthday each year. From 1895-1900 the group
         alternated their meeting place between Philadelphia and Boston. From 1901-1919,
         they met in New York, but other branches began to form in other cities across
         the United States. 123 issues of <span class="i">The Walt Whitman Papers</span>
         were pubished, filled with several essays on Whitman and his work. The
         organization and the <span class="i">Fellowship Papers</span> ended after
         Traubel's death in 1919.
