            </a> It is so customary to assume that the Negro has contributed nothing
         noteworthy to civilization, that a magazine, which in the interst of truth, will
         call attention to the other side of the ledger, will supply a distinct need and
         ought to be cordially and adequately supported.

      <h4>Carter G. Woodson (19 December 1875-3 April 1950)</h4>
      <p>Carter G. Woodson was a professor and historian at Howard University. He was
         among the first black scholars to receive a doctoral degree and a pioneer of
         black history and African American studies. He founded <span class="i">The
            Journal of African American History</span> (formally the <span class="i">Journal
            of Negro History</span>), in January 1916 as one of the first scholarly texts or
         journals to cover African-American history. Woodson was the editor until 1950
         (Korey Bowers Brown, &#x201c;Carter G. Woodson,&#x201d; <span class="i">Our History</span>
         Association for the Study of African American Life and History,

         Carter G. Woodson, as one of the first journals to cover African American

         not contribute any publications.
