                <note>Horace Traubel was an American poet, essayist, and author.

The two men had a friendly working relationship; Chesnutt was a fan of the magazine that Traubel founded, <hi rend="italic">The Conservator</hi>, and Traubel consistently praised Chesnutt and his writing in reviews featured in his periodical.</note>

                <note n="2">The review mentioned, signed "T.", calls Chesnutt "a poet" and praises the novel <hi rend="italic">Wife of His Youth</hi>. The reviewer writes, "Chesnutt likes to take his stand on this difficult ground and depict the struggle of the two natures. For a man or woman of mixed blood practically suffers two ostracisms instead of one....Chesnutt does not hesitate to put it under his glass and does not shudder over the results of his analysis. His stories, which are without formal start or finish are better than sermons. they do more for the negro than schools and benefactions....[Chesnutt] knows that his business is to get his pictures honest. He is not afraid to trust an honest picture. An honest picture never fails" (T. "The Wife of His Youth," <hi rend="italic">The Conservator</hi> 12, February 1902: 188).</note>

                <note>Chesnutt's ambitious and complex novel, <hi rend="italic">The Marrow of Tradition</hi>, was based on the 1898 race riot in Wilmington, North Carolina, which some of Chesnutt's relatives survived. This event left a considerable number of African Americans dead and expelled thousands more from their homes. Set in the fictional town of Wellington, The Marrow of Tradition centers on two prominent families, the Carterets and the Millers, and explores their remarkably intersected lives.</note>
                <note n="3">Chesnutt's novel, <hi rend="italic">Marrow of Tradition</hi> received a short listing in <hi rend="italic">The Conservator</hi> for December 1901 under "Books and Pamphlets Received" (A.M.
