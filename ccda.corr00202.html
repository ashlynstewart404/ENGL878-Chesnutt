      <h4>Richard Watson Gilder (1844-1909)</h4>
      <p>Richard Watson Gilder was a poet and editor of the Century magazine. &#x41d;e
         worked as a reporter for the <span class="i">Newark Daily Advertiser</span> and
         the <span class="i">Newark Morning Register</span> before becoming editor of
         the magazine <span class="i">Hours At Home</span> in 1869. When the latter was
         merged with the newly-founded <span class="i">Scribner's Monthly</span> the
         following year, Gilder was made assistant editor under Josiah Gilbert Holland.
         &#x41d;&#x435; succeeded Holland as editor-in-chief in 1881 and turned the publication,
         renamed <span class="i">The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine</span>, into
         the most renowned and influential general interest magazine in the United States
         ("Overview," <span class="i">Richard Watson Gilder papers, 1855-1916</span>
         Manuscripts and Archives Division, The New York Public Library, 1987: 1).

         The March of Progress
         
      </h4>
      <p>The short story "March of Progress" was published in <span class="i">The Century</span> in 1901, and it features a dramaticization of the problem
         facing a black schoolboard in Patesville, North Carolina in the 1880s (William
         L. Andrews, <span class="i">The Literary Career of Charles W. Chesnutt</span>,
         Louisiana State University Press, 1999: 82).

         The Century
         
      </h4>
      <p><span class="i">The Century Magazine</span> was an American magazine
         published by The Century Company that replaced <span class="i">Scribner's
            Monthly Magazine</span> in 1881. The magazine published illustrated articles on
         history, science, and literature, sometimes publishing fiction as well. In 1930,
         it merged with <span class="i">The Forum</span>.

         The Conjure Woman
         
      </h4>
      <p><span class="i">The Conjure Woman</span> is a collection of short
         stories by Chesnutt published in 1899. All of the tales are framed with
         narration by a white Northerner, John, who has travelled to the South with his
         wife, Annie, looking for a place to live. He recounts Uncle Julius, a man who
         was formerly enslaved on the land that the couple is looking to purchase,
         telling John and Annie conjure tales.

      <a id="hmc"></a><h4>Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Company</h4>
      <p>Initally founded in 1832 as Ticknor and Fields, the company published
         texts by impressive literary authors, including Thoreau, Hawthorne, and Emerson.
         In 1878, Ticknor and Fields was struggling financially, and merged with Henry
         Oscar Houghton's publishing company, Riverside Press, to form Houghton, Osgood
         and Company. Osgood left the business two years later and Houghton, Millin &amp;
         Co. was created. The company continued to primarily publish literary texts,
         deciding in 1891 to expand and also publish educational material.

      <a id=""></a><h4>
         The Wife of His Youth
         
      </h4>
      <p>After its publication in the <span class="i">Atlantic Monthly</span>,
         the short story "The Wife of His Youth" became the title piece of his collection
         of nondialect works published in 1899, <span class="i">The Wife of His Youth
            and Other Stories of the Color Line</span>. As the title suggests, each of the
         stories in the collection examine racial issues of the time.
