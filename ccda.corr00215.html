      <p>I take pleasure in enclosing my check for $1.00 for renewel of annual

            </a></p>
      
      <p>The Journal is a well edited dignified, worthy exponent of past and
         present-day historical facts which might, for the lack of such an organ, be
         neglected or overlooked. In this respect it meets a decided need, and its
         literary quality is well up to that of the more serious reviews.
      </p>
      
      <p>With congratulations on the success of the magazine and sincere
         wishes for its continued prosperity, I am,
