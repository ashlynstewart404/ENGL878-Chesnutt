                    sought-after writer at the turn of the century, popular with black and white
                    audiences alike, and his work was featured in many newspapers and magazines.

                <note>"The Haunted Oak," written and published in December 1900, in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Century</hi> was inspired in Washington, D.C., by a story that
                    Dunbar heard an old black man telling of his nephew in Alabama who was hanged
                    from an oak tree after having been falsely accused of "a grave crime." According
                    to the story, shortly afterwards the leaves on the limb, used for the lynching,
                    yellowed and fell off; and, unlike the rest of the normal tree, the offending
                    bough shriveled and died. Townspeople began to call the tree "the haunted oak."
                    Dunbar, using the ballad form to enhance the superstition, personifies the tree
                    and makes it the most sensitive and remorseful participant in the crime (James
                    A. Emanuel, "Racial Fire in the Poetry of Paul Laurence Dunbar," <hi
