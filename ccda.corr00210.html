      <p>Thank you very much for your kindly characterization of my work in
         The Conservator <a href="Conserv">
            *
            </a> in
         June. Appreciation of this sort is very encouraging. If present tendencies
         continue much longer, the colored people of this nation are likely to need
         friends and it is quite clear that they can count you among them.

      <h4>Horace Traubel (19 December 1858-9 September 1919)</h4>
      <p>Horace Traubel was an American poet, essayist, and author. Traubel was also a
         dedicated Socialist, and one of the founders of the socialist weekly newspaper
         <span class="i">The Worker</span>. He is best known for being Whitman's literary
         executor and author of a nine-volume biography of hitman's final four years
         (1888-1892), entitled <span class="i">Walt Whitman in Camden</span>.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <a id="Conserv"></a><h4>
         The Conservator
         
      </h4>
      <p><span class="i">The Conservator</span> was a monthly newspaper founded
         and edited by Traubel for 30 years. The newspaper frequently reflected its
         editor's idiosyncratic philosophy and crusaded for libertarian
         principles.
