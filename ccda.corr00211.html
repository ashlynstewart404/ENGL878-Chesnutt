      <p>On September 16th last I addressed you a letter, in which I enclosed
         a money order for $2.25, for a copy of the popular edition of Leaves of
         Grass"<a href="LoG">
            *
            </a> and a copy of
         "Chants Communal."<a href="Chants">
            *
            </a> As I
         have not received the books, I have been wondering if my letter miscarried or
         was perhaps mislaid after reaching its destination. If you will kindly let me
         know whether it came to hand or not, I shall be obliged.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Did you get a copy of "The Colonel's Dream"?<a href="Colsdream">
            *
            </a> I am under the impression that I requested my
         publishers to send it, though I presume you are on their list. I hope the book,
         or at least my motive in writing<span class="add">,</span> it will commend itself
         to you. I have just been reading your appreciation of Henry Irving<a href="hirving">
            *
            </a> it is very fine and very
         just. The world is better because he lived.

      <h4>Horace Traubel (19 December 1858-9 September 1919)</h4>
      <p>Horace Traubel was an American poet, essayist, and author. Traubel was also a
         dedicated Socialist, and one of the founders of the socialist weekly newspaper
         <span class="i">The Worker</span>. He is best known for being Whitman's literary
         executor and author of a nine-volume biography of Whitman's final four years
         (1888-1892), entitled <span class="i">Walt Whitman in Camden</span>.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <a id=""></a><h4>
         Leaves of Grass
         
      </h4>
      <p><span class="i">Leaves of Grass</span> is Walt Whitman's most renowned work;
         seven revised editions of the collection in Whitman's lifetime.
      </p>
      <p>The "popular edition" that Chesnutt refers to is likely the Deathbed
         Edition of <span class="i">Leaves of Grass</span>, published just two months
         before Whitman's death. In a statement announcing the publication of this
         edition, Whitman claimed that <span class="i">Leaves of Grass</span> was finally
         complete.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <a id=""></a><h4>
         Chant's Communal
         
      </h4>
      <p><span class="i">Chant's Communal</span>was a collection of many of the
         essays that Horace Traubel wrote for <span class="i">The Worker</span>, a weekly
         socialist newspaper that he helped found.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <a id=""></a><h4>
         The Colonel's Dream
         
      </h4>
      <p><span class="i">The Colonel's Dream</span> (1905) was Chesnutt's final
         novel. The book gained little critical attention and didn't sell well&#x2014;a
         reality that stood in opposition to the book's dedication: "to bring the forces
         of enlightenment to bear upon the vexed problems which harass the South." <span class="i">The Colonel's Dream</span> tells the story of Colonel French, a
         successful New York businessman and recent widow who returns to his Southern
         birthplace, Clarendon, with his son, Phil. French attempts to advance
         Clarendon's social and economic progress for the modern era, hoping to overcome
         its prejudices, rigid social divisions, and corruptions and finds a nemesis in
         the wealthy convict labor contractor, William Fetters. Ultimately, French
         underestimates the entrenched racism of the town, and despite his best efforts,
         Clarendon appears wholly unchanged.

      <h4>Henry Irving (6 February 1838-13 October 1905)</h4>
      <p>Sir Henry Irving was a renowned English actor and manager at the Lyceum
         Theater, where he eventually established his own Company. Throughout his
         lifetime, he starred in several shows, including <span class="i">Hamlet</span>,
         <span class="i">The Bells</span> and <span class="i">Queen Mary</span>. Irving
         was one of the inspirations for the character of Count Dracula. <span class="i">Dracula</span>'s author, Bram Stoker, worked as the business manager
         for Irving at the Lyceum Theater starting in 1878.
